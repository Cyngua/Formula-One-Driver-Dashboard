**[Formula 1 (F1) Overview](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/the-beginners-guide-to-the-f1-drivers-championship.53MjXJzTDxQnfxfoCLnxNZ)**: Each Formula 1 season spans a year and consists of approximately 20 to 30 races held in different locations worldwide. Each race determines a winner (1st place finisher) and the podium finishers (top 3 drivers: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places). The top 10 drivers of each race earn points based on their finishing positions. At the end of the season, the driver with the highest cumulative points is the World Drivers' Champion.<br>

The dataset contains **868** F1 drivers' name (primary key), nationality and race statistics.
